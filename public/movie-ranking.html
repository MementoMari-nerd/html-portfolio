<h3>The Princess bride</h3> 
<p>This movie has such a sweet tone from Westley's lovely "As you wish" to Buttercup learning the true meaning of that phrase.</p>

<h3>Monty Python and The Holy Grail</h3>
<p>This movie is a cult classic for a reasion. From the incredible tone and jokes of the movie.<br />
To the sound design since it had such a small budget. it has something for everyone.

<h3>Stardust</h3>
<p>A lovely movie following the story of two people. One of the main villains being played by Robert De Niro. I loved this movie as a kid and used to watch it multiple times while growing up.
